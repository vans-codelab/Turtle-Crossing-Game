# Turtle Crossing Game
Help your turtle cross the road without getting hit! 

### How it Works
Press the Up Arrow key to move your turtle across the street. After each level the cars will move faster - try to avoid getting hit!

### Features
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) design for clean and modular code
- Progressive increase in car speed after each level to enhance game difficulty
- Intro screen with game instructions before starting
- Player controls a turtle that can move upwards
- Dynamic display of current level and game elements during play

### Requirements
- **Programming Language:**
  Developed and tested with Python 3.11.  
  Download Python at: https://www.python.org/downloads/

- **Python Packages:**
  Uses only Python's standard libraries, no external packages required.

### Usage
1. **Download Files:**
   
   Click on the green "Code" button on GitHub and download the repository as a ZIP file.  
   Extract the folder and make sure all Python files are in the same directory.
   
2. **Run the Program:**
   
   Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are located.  
   Example:

       cd "C:\Caesar-Cipher\"

   Run **main.py** to start the program:
  
       python main.py

### Context
This project was developed as part of the "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course by Angela Yu on Udemy, where I deepened my understanding of Python programming.

The game is implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. After completing the project, I decided to add more features. 
For example, I programmed the cars to speed up progressively after each level, making the game more challenging. 
Additionally, I implemented an intro screen at the start of the game. 
This required modifying the code so that the playerâ€™s turtle and other game elements only become active once the game begins, including displaying the current level and cars.
